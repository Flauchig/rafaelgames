neste  projeto usei  o react e aprendi alguns conceitos 

1. aprendi o uso de state com react.
2. aprendi a conteinerização com a criação de componentes para o uso deles no código.
3. usei styled components ao inves da criação de arquivos css.
4. usei metodo onchange e aprendi sobre o método onBlur
5. e usei o conceito de props

e não foquei muito no conceito de estilização e sim no foco  mais em entender oque cada conceito faz 

 English version 

I learned how to use state in React.
I learned about componentization by creating reusable components for use throughout the code.
I used styled components instead of creating separate CSS files.
I used the onchange method and learned about the onBlur method.
I used the concept of props.
In this project, I used React and learned some core concepts:

I learned how to use state in React to manage component data.
I learned about componentization by creating reusable components for use throughout the code. This helps organize the code.
I used styled components instead of traditional CSS files to style components.
I used the onchange method to detect changes and learned about onBlur to detect when an element loses focus.
I used props to pass data between components.
So in summary, I gained experience with React state, componentization, styled components, event handling methods like onchange and onBlur, and props for passing data between components. This project helped reinforce foundational React concepts

i did not focus on concept of styling i just tried to understand what the code  and the concepts.
